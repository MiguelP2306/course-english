/*

it's super important to remember that the present tense has diferrent subcategories

present sente -> present simple -> verb to be
              |                 |-> other verb
              |
              |-> present continuous


  verb to be + other verb + ING = present continous



we use present simple when we want to talk about things that are always true, that happened all the time

i am a student

You can also use other verbs to talk about habits or repeated actions

i study at Platzi

We use it when we talk about actions that are happening at the moment that you are speaking
